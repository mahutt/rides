# Rides
Rides is an Express app that provides biking routes between a given location and destination.
Using collision and foot/bike/car traffic data made available by the city of Montreal, Rides provides the fastest, safest, and least-traffic routes a user could take.

Rides leverages the Google Maps & Destinations API to generate/render/explore bike paths and to render collision heat maps. A SQLite database is used to query traffic & collision data.
