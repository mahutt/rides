# Rides
Rides is an Express app that provides biking routes between a given location and destination.
Using [collision and foot/bike/car traffic data](https://donnees.montreal.ca) made available by the city of Montreal, Rides provides the fastest, safest, and least traffic-heavy routes a user could take.

Rides was built in 24 hours at ConUHacks VIII - a hackathon hosted by Concordia University. The app leverages the Google Maps & Destinations API to generate/render/explore bike paths and to render collision heat maps. A SQLite database is used to query traffic & collision data.
